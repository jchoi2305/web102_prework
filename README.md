## Notes

Challenges experienced throughout this prework were mainly syntax errors and refreshing my knowledge on javascript since it had been a little bit since I've used it. I also had to adjust the padding and layout a little bit to make it resemble the expected layout, which were again just mainly refreshers on CSS and HTML.
